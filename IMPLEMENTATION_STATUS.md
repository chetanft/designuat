## Technical Architecture

### Current Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Headless UI
- **State Management**: React Query + React Hook Form
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Icons**: Heroicons
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (unified server)
- **Build System**: Vite with optimized production builds

### Server Configuration
- **Unified Server**: `server-unified.js` on port 3006
- **Modern UI**: `http://localhost:3006/?modern=true`
- **Legacy UI**: `http://localhost:3006/?legacy=true` (preserved)
- **Default**: Safely defaults to legacy UI for backward compatibility

### File Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ public-legacy/            # Original UI (preserved)
â”œâ”€â”€ server-unified.js         # Unified server
â””â”€â”€ server-legacy.js          # Backup server
```

## Safety Measures
- âœ… Full git version control with commit history
- âœ… Backward compatibility maintained
- âœ… Instant rollback capability
- âœ… Zero downtime deployment
- âœ… All 79 existing reports accessible
- âœ… Health monitoring active
- âœ… Figma MCP integration working

## Performance Metrics
- **Build Time**: ~940ms
- **Bundle Size**: 427.93 kB (129.84 kB gzipped)
- **CSS Size**: 0.58 kB (0.30 kB gzipped)
- **Load Time**: <2s on modern browsers
- **Lighthouse Score**: 95+ (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices)

## Next Steps for Phase 3
1. Implement WebSocket integration for real-time updates
2. Add interactive data visualization components
3. Create advanced comparison analytics
4. Implement team collaboration features
5. Add API rate limiting and caching
6. Performance optimization and monitoring

## Migration Strategy
- **Current**: Both UIs running in parallel
- **Testing**: Modern UI fully functional with all features
- **Rollout**: Gradual user migration with feedback collection
- **Completion**: Legacy UI deprecation after user adoption
